## Project Overview

This project is a coverage-first empirical study of fixed-$K$ PSO niching with a single-pass Lloyd clustering step over particle-best positions, per-cluster best attractors, and weak-cluster reseeding. The primary contribution is engineering and empirical: a reproducible niching recipe, a Metal GPU realization, and a coverage-centric evaluation protocol. The work does not claim fundamentally new PSO dynamics; algorithmic novelty is limited to the reseeding and cluster-best coupling choices.

**Key features:**

- Metal GPU compute kernels (2D and N-dimensional)
- Fixed-$K$ niching (recommended default) plus exploratory enhanced mode (adaptive-$K$ + local refinement)
- Ring/lbest topology baseline on Metal (`--mode ring_lbest`)
- Coverage-centric metrics: BestCov, CentroidCov, MeanDist, MeanDist(repr), collapse diagnostics
- Reviewer-gap studies: CPU ablations, GPU ring comparison, nozzle/diffuser surrogate

## Quick Start

### 1. Compile GPU runners

From the `Shaders` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd src/gpu
xcrun swiftc metal_gpu_runner.swift -framework Metal -o ../../build/metal_gpu_runner
xcrun swiftc metal_gpu_runner_highdim.swift -framework Metal -o ../../build/metal_gpu_runner_highdim
cd ../..
```

If `xcrun` fails because the Xcode license has not been accepted, complete Apple's license acceptance locally and rebuild.

### 2. Run 2D benchmarks

```bash
./build/metal_gpu_runner --mode plain
./build/metal_gpu_runner --mode kmeans
./build/metal_gpu_runner --mode ring_lbest
./build/metal_gpu_runner --mode kmeans --enable-adaptive-k --enable-refinement
```

### 3. Run analysis scripts

```bash
python src/python/run_review_enhancements.py --trials 20
python src/python/run_reviewer_gap_study.py
python src/python/run_gpu_ring_comparison.py
python src/python/run_nozzle_surrogate.py
python src/python/plot_nozzle_results.py
```

### 4. Rebuild the manuscript PDF

```bash
cd docs/manuscripts
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode gpu_pso_multimodal_journal.tex
bibtex gpu_pso_multimodal_journal
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode gpu_pso_multimodal_journal.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode gpu_pso_multimodal_journal.tex
```

## Algorithm Summary

Each PSO iteration uses standard velocity/position updates. The social attractor is:

- **Plain mode:** global best
- **Niching mode:** cluster-best for the particle's assigned niche
- **Ring/lbest mode:** neighborhood best on a ring topology

Clustering is a **single-pass Lloyd update** (one assignment plus centroid recompute per PSO iteration), not full K-means to convergence. Clustering runs on particle-best positions; weak clusters are reseeded to farthest particle-best candidates to preserve diversity.

The Metal pipeline keeps **particle state GPU-resident** between phases; **centroid reduction is host-assisted** for deterministic, reproducible results (avoiding nondeterministic GPU atomics).

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Role |
|--------|------|
| **BestCov** | Primary: fraction of known optima with a returned cluster-best within $\epsilon$ |
| **CentroidCov** | Diagnostic: centroid-based coverage |
| **MeanDist** | Diagnostic: mean centroid-to-nearest-optimum distance |
| **MeanDist(repr)** | Mean distance of returned cluster-best representatives to nearest optima |
| **Largest-cluster fraction / entropy** | Collapse diagnostics |

For objectives without known minima, use returned-set clustering validity, archive spread, $\epsilon$-distinct solution count, and minimum separation between representatives.

---

## Main Findings

- Fixed-$K$ clustered PSO improves multimodal recovery over plain PSO on the main 2D benchmark suite (Himmelblau, Six-Hump Camel, Hölder Table, etc.).
- **Enhanced mode** (adaptive-$K$ + refinement) is a **tradeoff mode**: useful in selected cases but not uniformly better than fixed-$K$.
- On simple two-basin geometry (Six-Hump Camel), ring/lbest can be highly competitive; clustering helps more as basin count and geometry complexity increase.
- Hölder Table illustrates why BestCov (representatives) and CentroidCov (centroids) must be reported separately.
- Comparisons are scoped to **within the PSO family on Metal** (plain, fixed-$K$, enhanced, ring/lbest).

Reviewer-gap artifacts:

- `src/python/run_reviewer_gap_study.py` — ring/lbest baseline, ablations, coupling sweep
- `src/python/run_gpu_ring_comparison.py` — GPU plain vs K-means vs ring/lbest
- `results/paper_results/reviewer_gap_study_*.csv` — aggregated trial outputs

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3 or later recommended)
- macOS 12.0+
- Xcode command-line tools
- Python 3.8+ (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`)
- LaTeX (optional, for rebuilding the PDF)

---

## Scope and Limitations

- Strongest evidence is on 2D multimodal benchmarks with known optima; 5D/10D tests are limited validation.
- GPU/CPU timing is feasibility and mapping evidence, not a claim of universal hardware superiority.
- Apple Metal only in the current release; CUDA/SYCL ports are future work.
- Canonical niching baselines beyond ring/lbest (e.g., SPSO, clearing, fitness sharing) are not yet included.
